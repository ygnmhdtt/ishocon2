# This file has been automatically moved from your previous
# /etc/mysql/my.cnf, with just this comment added at the top, to maintain MySQL
# operation using your previously customised configuration.

# To switch to the new packaging configuration for automated management of
# /etc/mysql/my.cnf across multiple variants:
#
# 1. Move your customisations from this file to /etc/mysql/conf.d/ and
#    to /etc/mysql/<variant>.conf.d/ as appropriate.
# 2. Run "update-alternatives --remove my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf.migrated"
# 3. Remove the file /etc/mysql/my.cnf.migrated
